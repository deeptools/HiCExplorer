   Applying PCA to compute the global compartmentalization signal
   -----------------------------

   To our knoweldege this method has been first introduced by Wibke Schwarzer
   et al. 2017 (Nature. 2017 Nov 2; 551(7678): 51â€“56). In this method, a
   global (genome-wide) strength for compartmentalization is computed as
   (AA + BB) / (AB + BA)
   after rearranging the bins of obs/exp based on their corresponding pc1 values.
   For this purpose, first pc1 values are reordered incrementally, then the same
   order of bins is used to rearrange the bins in obs/exp matrix.
   .. code:: bash

   $ hicCompartmentsPolarization --obsexp_matrices obsExpMatrix.h5 --pca pc1.bedgraph
   -o global_signal.png
