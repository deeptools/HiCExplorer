   :prog: hicPlotTADs


hicPlotTADs output is similar to a genome browser screen-shot that besides the usual genes,
and score data (like bigwig or bedgraph files) also contains Hi-C data. The plot is composed of
tracks that need to be specified in a configuration file. Once the tracks file is ready,
hicPlotTADs can be used as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ hicPlotTADs --tracks tracks.ini --region chr1:1,000,000-2,000,000  -o tads.pdf


The following is a template for the configuration file which is based on .ini configuration files. Each
track is defined by a section header (for example `[hic track]`), followed by parameters specific to the
section as `color`, `title`, etc.


.. code-block:: INI

   # lines that start with '#' are comment lines
   # and are not interpreted by the program
   # the different tracks are represented by sections in this file
   # each section starts with a header of the form [hic]
   # the content of the section label (in the previous example 'hic') is irrelevant for
   # plotting and only used to tell the user when something goes wrong.
   # There are two exceptions for this, the [x-axis] and the [spacer] sections
   # that use the section label to determine the action.

   # of genomic positions. However, sometimes to give a file
   # is more convenient in case many lines want to be plotted.
